This is an attempt to transform messy data into Tidy Data.

```{r}
library(historydata)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

```



```{r}

setwd("~/Documents/Clio3/rproject")
sarna <- read.csv("historydata/data-raw/sarna.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

sarna %>% 
  gather(data = sarna, type, numb, estimate_low:estimate_high:percentage_pop_low:percentage_pop_high)


#The gather command by itself works, but not with sarna%>% executed before it. Also, need to find a way to write this out and save what I have.
```

```{r}

```

```{r}


```
